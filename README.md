Patch for ShiftOS 0.0.9 to make it actually work.
If you see any bugs then open an issue and I'll try to fix them
\- or if you're feeling nice, make a PR and save me the trouble.
If you want new features, don't bother poking around here, ya dangus.
This version of the game isn't even all that appealing, and I'm just
fixing it for the memories.
[The new version](https://github.com/shiftos-game/ShiftOS) has actual
gameplay and story elements, and isn't written in Visual Basic. Go check
that out instead.
